Programming notes::

Goal:
  Take the pollen forcast data from http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/ddc/ and display it using four options.

Low = Green
Medium = Yellow
High = Red
Very High = Flashing Red

Input:
  parsed xml response from http get request


  GET /public/val/wxfcs/all/xml/3839?res=daily&key=<mykey> HTTP/1.0
    (replace mykey with a valid key)
  The key provided and demonstrated on http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/premium/ddc/previewData.html doesn't work for me.

  Searching for alternative data sources resulted in located this code http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1231812230
    that can run entirely on an arduino with a ethernet shield (after miner fixes)
    This code connects to the www.weather.gov side and gets an xml file that it searched thru for information
    It output the following
      Starting WebWx
      connecting...
      connected
      Temp: 61.0, Humidity: 93, Pressure: 29.65


Output:
  six digital outs for the light sources
