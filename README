Project Description:
  Display the days pollen forcast.
    Three orbs for three allergens
      Grass, Rapeseed, and Nettles
    Four levels per orb
      Green, Yellow, Red, and Flashing Red


Programming notes::

Goal:
  Take the pollen forcast data from http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/public/ddc/ and display it using four options.

Low = Green
Medium = Yellow
High = Red
Very High = Flashing Red

Input:
  parsed xml or json response from http get request
    reviewing the sample xml met office data, it seems like it might be a better option to use json data.
      https://github.com/interactive-matter/aJson
    Once the met office data is live a better desision can be made.

  GET /public/val/wxfcs/all/xml/3839?res=daily&key=<mykey> HTTP/1.0
    (replace mykey with a valid key)
  The key provided and demonstrated on http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/premium/ddc/previewData.html doesn't work for me.

  Searching for alternative data sources resulted in located this code http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1231812230
    that can run entirely on an arduino with a ethernet shield or Arduino Ethernet board (after miner fixes)
    This code connects to the www.weather.gov site and gets an xml file that it searched thru for information
    It output the following
      Starting WebWx
      connecting...
      connected
      Temp: 61.0, Humidity: 93, Pressure: 29.65
    
    This allows it to work without a computer, just an ethernet connection and a power supply.


Output:
  nine digital outs for the light sources pin 1 to 9
    1 = Low Grass
    2 = Medium Grass
    etc.
